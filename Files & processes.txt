Problem Statement:

You are hosting a system network, where you have two processes running in background. First
one is a process to monitor the uptime of each system and second one is a process that keeps
track of all processes running in the working environment. The priority value of the first process
is 8. The priority value of the second process is lower than the first process. Use 'renice' to
change the priority. 

Solution:

sudo renice -10 PID(second_process)
