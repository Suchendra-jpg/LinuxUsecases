3)	service httpd status.

4)	Launch Web browser and type "localhost" in URL.


To display desired text in web browser you can follow below steps:

1)	cd /

2)	cd var

3)	cd www

4)	cd html

5)	sudo nano index.html (Write desired content you want to see in web browser)

6)	Launch Web browser and type "localhost" in URL.


FYI: By default all web browsers will look for index.html file to fetch the contents in that file.


If you want to fetch contents from a file other than index.html you can follow below steps:

1) sudo nano display.html  (create this file inside html directory present in root)

2) Launch web browser and type "localhost/display.html" in URL.
