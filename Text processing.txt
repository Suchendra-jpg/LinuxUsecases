Module 6 - Assignment

Problem Statement:

In your primary system you have a folder consist that consists of the dataset that we needto perform task on. Mount the folder to the Linux operating system. The dataset is stored
in zipped file. Extract the file using 'zip' command. You can find the dataset in the attachment. Once done mounting perform the tasks given below:

a) Write an awk program to print out only the Name of the game and Year of release
b) Write an awk program to print only the Name column from the row 200 to row 210
c) Write an awk program to print all the games released on the year 2005 between the rows 100 to 500

Solution:

1)	Created folder named "shared" in PC which consists of zipfile "linux_mod6_dataset".

2)	Add the above folder to Shared folders under Settings in Virtualbox and start linux os.

3) Run the below commands:
	mkdir ~/shared
	
4)	$ sudo mount -t vboxsf shared ~/shared

5)	$ cd ~/share

6)	$ sudo yum install unzip 

7)	$ unzip linux_mod6_dataset.zip

8)	$ awk '{print $2,$4}' linux_mod6_dataset.csv

9)	$ awk 'NR >=200 && NR <=210 {print $2}' linux_mod6_dataset.csv
	
10)	$ awk 'NR >=100 && NR <= 500 {print $2}' linux_mod6_dataset.csv | awk -F, '$4 == "2005"' linux_mod6_dataset.csv
