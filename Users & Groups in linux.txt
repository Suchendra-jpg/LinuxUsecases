You have been asked to:
1. Create 3 users for the people in our server
2. Create a group named “webdev” and add them in it
3. Create a folder named “dev” with a file inside and give the file permission to be only opened by this group’s users

id pm

sudo groupadd webdev
grep webdev /etc/group
sudo gpasswd -M developer,tester,pm webdev
grep webdev /etc/group

mkdir dev
nano newfile.txt
chmod 040 newfile.txt
chown :webdev newfile.txt

sudo gpasswd -d pm webdev
userdel -r pm

mv dev/newfile.txt dev2
chown :newgroup newfile.txt
